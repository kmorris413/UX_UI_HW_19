                    <p class="backgroundText"style="text-align: left">I received my Bachelor's in Education and minor in Art & Design 
                                                which provided me with skills such as communication, collaboration, 
                                                multitasking and empathy. Later on I continued to develop strong 
                                                skills and experience with creativity, attention to detail, problem 
                                                solving, time management and organization by working in the skincare 
                                                industry. My strongest passions in life have always been centered 
                                                around art and design which led me to pursue a career in UX/UI design. 
                                                I experience great enjoyment collaborating with other creative 
                                                individuals and strive to make positive differences in people's 
                                                lives through my work. My background experiences and skills paired 
                                                with my artistic passions make me a valuable addition to any team.</p>

                    <p class="funfactsText"style="text-align: left">In my free time I can be found doing all the typical Colorado 
                                                activities such as hiking and exploring the outdoors with my 
                                                Corgi pup. You can also find me behind my sewing machine 
                                                designing and making my own clothing and accessories while
                                                jamming out to music. My definition of a perfect Friday night
                                                is having a wildly fun game night with all of my closest friends
                                                (the more food the better). I love making new connections so feel
                                                free to reach out and say "hi!"</p>
